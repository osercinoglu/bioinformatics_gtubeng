# Bioinformatics Learning Resources and Exercises

## What is this repository all about? 

This repository stores a list of recommended resources and bioinformatics exercises for two courses taught at Gebze Technical University in Fall 2024 Semester:
* BSB511 - Bioinformatics Fundamentals, a graduate-level course taught at GTU Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program.
* BENG451 - Introduction to Bioinformatics, an undergraduate-level course taught at GTU Bioengineering Undergraduate Program.

The jupyter notebooks containing the exercises can be found in folder "exercises". 

Lecture Slides are shared via MS Teams groups created for these courses.

While the two courses share the same theoretical content, the skills required to complete the course successfully differ:

* Homework exercises for BENG451 focuses solely on achieving a basic understanding of the relevant bioinformatics methods, and no particular coding skills are required. One can basically complete each task by using web interfaces of the required tools. However, those interested in delving deeper into the coding aspects may also prefer to complete coding homeworks assigned to BSB511 students. Bonus points will be added to the final grade for students who choose to complete homeworks this way.
* Homework exercises for BSB511 requires more than a demonstration of a basic understanding: the student should also show acquiral of coding skills for achieve pre-defined bioinformatics tasks.

There will also be project tasks assigned to groups of students later on during the semester. More information about this will be shared in due time. Stay tuned!

## Contact

In case of any problems with the exercises, you can use the Issues tab or directly contact the course instructor.
