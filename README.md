# Bioinformatics Learning Resources and Exercises

## What is this repository all about? 

This repository stores a list of recommended resources and bioinformatics exercises for two courses taught at Gebze Technical University in Fall/Spring Semesters:
* BSB511 - Bioinformatics Fundamentals, a graduate-level course taught at GTU Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program.
* BENG451 - Introduction to Bioinformatics, an undergraduate-level course taught at GTU Bioengineering Undergraduate Program.

The jupyter notebooks containing the exercises can be found in folder "exercises". 

Lecture Slides are shared via MS Teams groups created for these courses.

There will also be project tasks assigned to groups of students later on during the semester. More information about this will be shared in due time. Stay tuned!

## Contact

In case of any problems with the exercises, you can use the Issues tab or directly contact the course instructor.

## Homeworks

Homeworks handed out as part of the course (both current and past) can be found under homeworks folder.
